Calling main() at the end of your file serves a specific purpose.

When you run a Python file directly (like when you execute python3 main.py), Python executes all the code in that file from top to bottom. However, simply defining functions doesn't execute the code inside them - functions only run when they're called.

So if you only defined your get_book_text and main functions without calling main() at the end, nothing would actually happen when you run your program! The functions would be defined but never executed.

By adding main() at the end, you're telling Python: "After you've defined all these functions, now actually run the main function."

This pattern also has another benefit: if someone imports your file as a module in another program, your main() function won't automatically execute. This gives other programmers the flexibility to use your functions without running your main program logic.

It's a bit like writing a recipe (the function definitions) and then actually cooking the meal (calling main()).

#####
n your get_book_text() function, the return f.read() is indented one level because it's inside the with block. This is correct because the file needs to be open when you read from it.

In your count_words() function, the return word_count is at the same indentation level as the rest of the function body. This is also correct since it's not inside any nested block.

Both functions have proper indentation for their context. The indentation in Python indicates code blocks, and the with statement in the first function creates a block that needs to be indented.

#####

The with statement in Python creates what's called a "context manager." It's primarily used for resource management - automatically handling setup and cleanup tasks.
```
with open(filepath) as f:
    return f.read()
```
The with block does several important things:

It opens the file at the specified filepath
It assigns the file object to the variable f
When the code inside the block finishes executing, it automatically closes the file
This is particularly useful for file operations because:

You don't have to remember to close the file manually
The file gets closed properly even if an error occurs
It makes your code cleaner and more readable

Without using with, you'd need to handle opening and closing explicitly:

```
f = open(filepath)
try:
    return f.read()
finally:
    f.close()
```
So the with block is a more elegant way to ensure files get properly opened and closed. Any code indented under the with statement is executed while the file is open, and then the file is automatically closed when that block ends.

The with statement in Python is quite versatile and not limited to just file operations.

While files are perhaps the most common use case, with can be used with any object that follows the "context manager" protocol (implements __enter__ and __exit__ methods). Here are some other common uses:

Network connections:

with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
    # Connection operations

Database transactions:

with connection:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM table")

The with statement is a powerful tool for any situation where you need setup and cleanup actions around a block of code. It ensures resources are properly managed even if exceptions occur.
