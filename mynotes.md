Calling main() at the end of your file serves a specific purpose.

When you run a Python file directly (like when you execute python3 main.py), Python executes all the code in that file from top to bottom. However, simply defining functions doesn't execute the code inside them - functions only run when they're called.

So if you only defined your get_book_text and main functions without calling main() at the end, nothing would actually happen when you run your program! The functions would be defined but never executed.

By adding main() at the end, you're telling Python: "After you've defined all these functions, now actually run the main function."

This pattern also has another benefit: if someone imports your file as a module in another program, your main() function won't automatically execute. This gives other programmers the flexibility to use your functions without running your main program logic.

It's a bit like writing a recipe (the function definitions) and then actually cooking the meal (calling main()).

#####
n your get_book_text() function, the return f.read() is indented one level because it's inside the with block. This is correct because the file needs to be open when you read from it.

In your count_words() function, the return word_count is at the same indentation level as the rest of the function body. This is also correct since it's not inside any nested block.

Both functions have proper indentation for their context. The indentation in Python indicates code blocks, and the with statement in the first function creates a block that needs to be indented.
